Predicting Video Game Success: Analyzing Trends and Patterns from 2016 Data

# Project Title: Analysis of Video Game Sales for Ice Online Store

## Objective
Identify patterns that determine whether a video game succeeds or not to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns for the online store Ice.

## Key Responsibilities
- **Load and Inspect Datasets**: Open the data file and study the general information.
- **Data Preparation and Cleaning**: 
  - Replace column names with lowercase.
  - Convert data to appropriate types.
  - Handle missing values appropriately, considering possible reasons for missing data and addressing "TBD" cases.
  - Calculate total sales (sum of sales in all regions) for each game and add as a new column.
- **Data Analysis**:
  - Analyze the number of games released in different years to determine data significance for each period.
  - Examine sales variations across different platforms and identify the most profitable ones.
  - Build sales distribution for each year and find platforms with zero sales over time.
  - Determine the lifespan of platforms and select relevant data for building a 2017 model.
  - Identify leading, growing, and shrinking platforms in sales.
  - Create box plots for global sales of games by platform and analyze the differences.
  - Study the impact of user and professional reviews on sales for a popular platform using scatter plots and correlation calculations.
  - Compare the sales of the same games on different platforms.
  - Examine the distribution of games by genre to identify the most profitable genres.
- **User Profile Creation**:
  - Determine the top five platforms and genres for each region (NA, EU, JP).
  - Analyze variations in market shares and genre preferences across regions.
  - Study the effect of ESRB ratings on sales in each region.
- **Hypothesis Testing**:
  - Formulate and test hypotheses:
    - Average user ratings of the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same.
    - Average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres are different.
  - Set and explain the significance level for hypothesis testing.
- **General Conclusion**: Summarize the findings and insights gained from the analysis.
